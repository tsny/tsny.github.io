My first software development position was nothing like what I had pictured.
Like any young programmer in uni, I completely expected to work with a team of like-minded tech people in a nice
open room with bean bag chairs and string lights. Requirements would come to us and we'd churn out changes and MAKE things.

What actually happened was quite a bit different. I joined a team managing an instance of a monolithic Java application that about 8000 nurses used each day
in their work with Medicare and Medicaid patients.

The problem with this app being a monolith was that it was the singular integration point for a huge part of the IT department.
Every other team would have to use it's API's and various services.

Our team was responsible for *EVERY* single integration point.

I knew nothing about medical management or literally anything healthcare related.
The workspace was pretty tech-ish but so much of the entire enterprise was insanely corporate.
The management was great and the people were insanely nice and supportive, but it always seemed like nothing was going on.
Requirement hell would go on for sprint after sprint. Stories were closed half-way through because no one knew what to do with them.
People came and went so fast that their unique responsibilities were dropped on the next person in line.
